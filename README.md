# Meteora

Meteora is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency with advanced privacy preserving characteristics.

It was developed as part of my bachelor thesis at the University of Mannheim.


This repository holds the code devloped for the thesis and an additional Python script to test the functionality of the smart contracts and the signature verfication. As the verification process is very cost intensive, it might be needed to increase the gas price or increase the block size limit in the Testnet to guarantee full execution.
